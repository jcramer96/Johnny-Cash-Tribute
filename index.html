        <h3>Timeline of Cash's Life</h3>
          <ul id="tribute-info">
            <li>1932- Johnny Cash (back then known as J.R.) was born in Kingsland, Arkansas.</li>
            <li>1935- Cash Family settled in Dyess, Arkansas on a Depression-era cotton field where the entire family worked to bring in as much income as they could. It was through this experience that Johnny discovered his heart for the poor and working class.</li>
            <li>1944- Cash’s older brother, Jack, sustained an injury while cutting metal piping at work. The unguarded table saw cut into his chest, almost cutting him in two. Jack died a week later in the hospital due to the severity of his injuries.</li>
            <li>1944- Cash learned guitar from his mother and childhood friend and began playing and writing songs at the age of 12. He was strongly influenced by gospel music and the radio.</li>
            <li>1950- Cash enlisted in the Air Force and was stationed in Landsberg, West Germany. This was shortly after he met his first wife Vivian, and the couple proceeded to write thousands of letters back-and-forth during his time overseas.</li>
            <li>1954- Cash was honorably discharged from the Air Force and moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where he became a door-to-door appliance salesman while studying to become a radio announcer.</li>
            <li>1955- Cash’s first recordings with Sun Records, “Hey Porter” and “Cry! Cry! Cry!”</li>
            <li>1958- Cash left Sun Records for Columbia Records. During this time, Cash started to use amphetamines in order to stay awake during long tours, but quickly became addicted to the substances– a battle that he fought for decades on-end.</li>
            <li>1960- Cash begins touring with the famed Carter Family, where he met his future second wife, June. Despite writing the song “Walk the Line” for his first wife (a song about remaining faithful in the face of temptation), Johnny quickly fell for June while touring with her.</li>
            <li>1967- Cash arrested in Walker County, Georgia after police found him carrying a bag of prescription pills and was in a car accident. Sheriff Ralph Jones released him after giving him a long talk, warning him about the danger of his behavior and wasted potential. Cash described this as the moment that helped him turn his life around. June, Maybelle, and Ezra Carter moved into Cash’s mansion for a month to help him get off drugs.</li>
            <li>1968- Cash proposed to June Carter onstage at the London Gardens in London, Ontario, Canada. June and Johnny married a week later in Franklin, Kentucky.</li>
            <li>1969- Cash became the host of The Johnny Cash Show where he hosted a wide variety of mainstream performers from all different genres of music. Some iconic musicians who made guest appearances on the show include Bob Dylan, Creedance Clearwater Revival, and Roy Orbison.</li>
            <li>1970- Cash had solidified his persona as “The Man in Black” by this time, frequently wearing black suits while performing. He claimed to wear black on behalf of the poor and hungry, the “prisoner who has long paid for his crime, and those who have been betrayed by age or drugs.”</li>
            <li>1997- Cash was diagnosed with Shy-Drager syndrome, a neurodegenerative disease, and was told he had 18 months to live. However, he lived for 6 more years and continued to produce music. Astonishingly, he produced a total of 60 songs just in the last 4 months of his life.</li>
            <li>2003- June Carter Cash passes away on May 15, and Johnny Cash passes away just 4 months after her. They are buried together near his home in Hendersonville, Tennessee.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><i>“I wore black because I liked it. I still do, and wearing it still means something to me. It’s still a symbol of rebellion – against a stagnant status quo, against our hypocritical houses of God, against people whose minds are closed to others’ ideas.” -Johnny Cash</i></p>
